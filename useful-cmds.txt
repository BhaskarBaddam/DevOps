# Before executing the playbook, perform a syntax check to catch any YAML or syntax errors:
ansible-playbook k8s-worker.yml --syntax-check

# Perform a dry run to see what changes would be made without actually applying them:
ansible-playbook k8s-worker.yml --check --extra-vars "@vars.yml"

# Actual command to be executed
ansible-playbook k8s-worker.yml --extra-vars "@vars.yml"
